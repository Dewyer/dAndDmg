### D & D Damage
Is challange rating good ?
How do you your party can beat an encounter ?
Well you just dont, and I am here to simulate it for you.

This thing will target the all mighty d&d e5.

### 1. Milestone
- Add monsters and players
- Basic attacks, they hit each other and we see what happens
- No fancier stuff than normal attacks
- Dice + mod vs AC doing dmg
- Everyone is trying to do max dmg
- Monsters and players operate the same way here
